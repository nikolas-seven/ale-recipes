        <li>8 slices bacon, diced</li>
        <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>clove garlic, minced</li>
        <li>¼ cup dry white wine</li>
        <li>4 large eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>½ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>    
        <li>salt and black pepper to taste</li>

    <div class="steps"><h3>Hands On Baby!</h3>
    <ol>
        <p><strong>Step 1</strong></p>
        <p>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook spaghetti in boiling water, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes. 
            Drain, toss spaghetti with 1 tablespoon olive oil, and set aside.</p>     
    </ol>
    <ol><p><strong>Step 2</strong></p>
        <p>Place diced bacon in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon on paper towels, 
            reserving 2 tablespoons bacon fat in the skillet.</p>     
    </ol>
    <ol><p><strong>Step 3</strong></p>
        <p>Add 1 tablespoon olive oil to bacon fat in the skillet. Add chopped onion and cook over medium heat until onion is translucent. Add minced garlic and cook 
            until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add wine and cook 1 minute more.</p>     
    </ol>
    <ol><p><strong>Step 4</strong></p>
        <p>Return cooked bacon to the skillet; add cooked spaghetti. Toss to coat and heat through, adding more olive oil if it seems dry or sticks together. Add beaten eggs and cook, tossing constantly with tongs or a large fork, until eggs are barely set. Quickly add 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese and toss again. Season with 
            salt and pepper (remember that bacon and Parmesan are very salty).</p>     
    </ol>
    <ol><p><strong>Step 5</strong></p>
        <p>Serve warm with chopped parsley sprinkled on top and extra Parmesan cheese at the table.</p>
